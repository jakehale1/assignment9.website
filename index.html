							<p>I am a dedicated and passionate student attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, majoring in Environmental Science. With a keen interest in data science, I am excited to explore new ways to use data to address environmental issues and improve sustainability. Ultimately, I aspire to use my skills to make a positive impact in the field of animal conservation. In my free time, I am a huge fan of UNC basketball, and love nothing more than cheering on the Tar Heels with fellow fans. As someone who is adaptable and quick to learn, I am confident in my ability to take on new challenges and work collaboratively with others to achieve our goals. When I'm not studying or watching basketball, I enjoy spending time in nature, hiking, and exploring the great outdoors.</p>

								<p>I have gained diverse work experience across various industries, from agriculture to non-profit organizations. As an Undergraduate Researcher at the Lohmann Lab at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, I study the use of the Earth's magnetic field by sea turtles, salmon, and lobsters for long-distance navigation. My responsibilities include cultivating, breeding, and growing turtles, lobsters, and flounder, using the BORIS program to collect and analyze biological data, and analyzing trends between aquatic organisms and their environment.</p>
								<p>I also gained valuable experience in social impact work as an Intern at No Kid Hungry in Bakersfield, CA. In this role, I was responsible for lunch and dinner distribution for 2000 children per day across 18 local sites, and supervised 5 high school interns. I also monitored food distribution, ensuring that meals were delivered to the correct recipients and FDA guidelines were followed, and created a three-week after-school teaching curriculum.</p>
								<p>In addition, I have experience in retail as a Sales Clerk/Courtesy Clerk at Albertsons Grocery Store in Bakersfield, CA, where I provided customer service, worked the front-end checkout stand, and stocked shelves. I also worked as a Grape Picker at Cattani Farms, participating in the inspection, grading, sorting, storage, and post-harvest treatment of crops, and loading agricultural products into trucks.</p>

								<p> UNC offers a range of environmental science classes that provide students with a solid foundation in the principles and practices of sustainability. These courses cover topics such as climate change, conservation, ecology, and renewable energy, among others. By taking environmental science classes at UNC, students can gain a deeper understanding of the natural world and develop the skills and knowledge needed to tackle pressing environmental challenges. These are some of the classes I am taking right now.</p>
